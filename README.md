# FinOps Cloud Spend & Forecast Analysis – Powered by FOCUS Dataset

This project analyzes cloud cost data using the [FOCUS Dataset](https://focus.finops.org/sandbox), a standardized data model from the FinOps Foundation designed to simulate public cloud spend scenarios.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard was built using Power BI and includes:

- **Actual vs Forecasted Cloud Spend**
- **Cost breakdown by service, environment, and account**
- **Usage hours vs total cost**
- **Quarterly trends in cloud expenses**
- **Interactive filters** (Service, Account ID, Environment)
